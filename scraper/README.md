# Scraping-TripAdvisor-with-Selenium-2019

Python implementation of web scraping of TripAdvisor with Selenium in a new 2019 website.

The python function is fully commented, write me if you have doubts.

Features implemented: 
  - The click function to open the "more" button of the reviews 
  - The click function to change the page
  - The click function to select only the desired rating (ex: if you wanna only the reviews with 5 stars)
  
In the .csv file "reviewALL.csv" there is an exemple of dataset approximately with 10000 italian reviews labeled from 1 to 5 stars.
